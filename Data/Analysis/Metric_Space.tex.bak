\section{Definitions and Concepts}

\subsection{Definitions}

\begin{definition}[metric\index{metric}, metric space\index{metric space}]\label{def:metric}
A metric on a set $X$ is a function (called the distance function or simply distance) $d : X \times X \to \R$ (where $\R$ is the set of real numbers). For all $x, y, z \in X$, this function is required to satisfy the following conditions:
\ben
\item [(i)] $d(x, y) \geq 0$. (non-negativity, or separation axiom)
\item [(ii)] $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$. (identity of indiscernibles, or coincidence axiom)
\item [(iii)] $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$. (symmetry)
\item [(iv)] $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$. (subadditivity / triangle inequality)
\een

Then $(X,d)$ is called metric space.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Note that (i) and (ii) together produce positive definiteness and (i) is implied by the others.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[ultrametric\index{ultrametric}]\label{def:ultrametric}
A metric is called an ultrametric if it satisfies the following stronger version of the triangle inequality where points can never fall `between' other points:
\be
d(x, z) \leq \max\bra{d(x, y), d(y, z)},\quad \forall x, y, z \in X.
\ee
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[intrinsic metric\index{intrinsic metric}]\label{def:intrinsic_metric}
A metric $d$ on $X$ is called intrinsic if any two points $x,y \in X$ can be joined by a curve with length arbitrarily close to $d(x, y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[translation invariant metric\index{translation invariant!metric}]\label{def:translation_invariant_metric}
For sets on which an addition $+ : X \times X \to X$ is defined, $d$ is called a translation invariant metric if
\be
d(x, y) = d(x + a, y + a),\quad x,y \in X.
\ee
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[pseudometric\index{pseudometric}]\label{def:pseudometric}
A pseudometric on $X$ is a function $d : X \times X \to \R$ which satisfies the axioms for a metric, except that instead of the second (identity of indiscernibles) only $d(x,x)=0$ for all $x$ is required. In other words, the axioms for a pseudometric are: for any $x,y,z \in X$,
\ben
\item [(i)] $d(x, y) \geq 0$.
\item [(ii)] $d(x, x) = 0$ (but possibly $d(x,y)=0$ for some distinct values $x\neq y$).
\item [(iii)] $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$.
\item [(iv)] $d(x, z) \leq  d(x, y) + d(y, z)$.
\een
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
This is the most common generalization of metrics. In some contexts, pseudometrics are referred to as semimetrics because of their relation to seminorms\footnote{need details}.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[quasimetric\index{quasimetric}]\label{def:quasimetric}
A quasimetric is defined as a function that satisfies all axioms for a metric with the possible exception of symmetry:
\ben
\item [(i)] $d(x, y) \geq 0$. (positivity)
\item [(ii)] $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$. (positive definiteness)
\item [(iii)] $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$ (triangle inequality)
\een
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Quasimetrics are common in real life. For example, given a set $X$ of mountain villages, the typical walking times between elements of $X$ form a quasimetric because travel up hill takes longer than travel down hill. Another example is a taxicab geometry topology having one-way streets, where a path from point $A$ to point $B$ comprises a different set of streets than a path from $B$ to $A$. Nevertheless, this notion is rarely used in mathematics, and its name is not entirely standardized (see Rolewicz\cite{Rolewicz_1987}).
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
A quasimetric on the reals can be defined by setting
\be
d(x, y) = \left\{ \ba{ll}
x - y\quad\quad & x \geq y,\\
1 & \text{otherwise}
\ea\right.
\ee

The 1 may be replaced by infinity or by $1+10(y-x)$.

The topological space underlying this quasimetric space is the Sorgenfrey line. This space describes the process of filing down a metal stick: it is easy to reduce its size, but it is difficult or impossible to grow it.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
If $d$ is a quasimetric on $X$, a metric $d'$ on $X$ can be formed by taking
\be
d'(x, y) = (d(x, y) + d(y, x))/2.
\ee
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[semimetric\index{semimetric}]\label{def:semimetric}
A semimetric on $X$ is a function $d : X \times X \to\R$ that satisfies the first three axioms, but not necessarily the triangle inequality:
\ben
\item [(i)] $d(x, y) \geq 0$.
\item [(ii)] $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
\item [(iii)] $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$.
\een
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Some mathematicians work with a weaker form of the triangle inequality, such as:
\beast
& & d(x, z) \leq \rho (d(x, y) + d(y, z)) \qquad (\text{$\rho$-relaxed triangle inequality})\\
& & d(x, z) \leq \rho \max\bra{d(x, y), d(y, z)}\qquad (\text{$\rho$-inframetric inequality}).

\section{Continuity in Metric Space}

\begin{definition}[continuity in metric space\index{continuous!metric space}]\label{def:continuous_metric_space}
Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f:X\to Y$ is called continuous at $x\in X$ if given any $\ve>0$, we can find a $\delta (x,\ve)>0$ such that
\be
d_Y(f(x),f(x'))< \ve \quad \text{whenever }\ d_X(x,x')<\delta(x,\ve).
\ee

We say that $f$ is continuous if $f$ is continuous at every $x\in X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[open ball\index{open ball!metric space}]\label{def:open_ball_metric_space}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, $x_0\in X$ and $r>0$ a real number. The open ball in $X$ of radius $r$ centred on $x_0$ is the set
\be
B_r(x_0) = \bra{x\in X:d(x,x_0) < r}.
\ee

If we are considering more than one metric on $X$ then we write $B^d_r (x_0)$. We can also write $B_r(x_0) = B(r,x_0)$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[equivalent definition of continuity at point]
Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f:X\to Y$ is called continuous at $x\in X$ if and only if for any $\ve >0$, there exists $\delta >0$ such that
\be
f\bb{B^{d_X}_\delta(x)} \subseteq B^{d_Y}_\ve\bb{f(x)}.
\ee
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[Lipschitz continuous\index{Lipschitz continuous!metric space}]\label{def:lipschitz_continuous}\footnote{need checking}
Given two metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$, where $d_X$ denotes the metric on the set $X$ and $d_Y$ is the metric on set $Y$. A function $f: X \to Y$ is called Lipschitz continuous if there
exists a real constant $K \geq 0$ such that, for all $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $X$,
\be
d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) \le K d_X(x_1, x_2).
\ee

Any such $K$ is referred to as a Lipschitz constant\index{Lipschitz constant} for the function $f$. The smallest constant is sometimes called the (best) Lipschitz constant. The space of Lipschitz
continuous functions with constant $K$ is $\lip_K(X,Y)$ and the space of Lipschitz continous functions on $X$ is $\lip(X,Y) = \bigcup\limits_{K>0}\lip_K(X,Y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\footnote{need checking}
Lipschitz continuity is a strong form of uniform continuity.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:zero_one_lipschitz}\footnote{need checking}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. For any closed set $A\subseteq X$ and any $\ve>0$, there is a Lipschitz continuous map $\rho_{A,\ve}:X\to [0,1]$ with
\be
\rho_{A,\ve}(x) = \left\{\ba{ll}
1 \quad\quad & \text{if }x\in A,\\
0 & \text{if }d(x,A) \geq \ve.
\ea\right.
\ee
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]\footnote{need checking}
Let $\varphi:\R \to [0,1]$, $t \mapsto (t\vee 0)\wedge 1$. For $x\in X$, define $\rho_{A,\ve} = 1 - \varphi(\ve^{-1}d(x,A))$.
\end{proof}

\section{Open Sets in Metric Space}


\subsection{Open sets in metric space}



\begin{definition}[open set\index{open set!metric space}]\label{def:open set_metric_space}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. We say that a subset $A$ is open in $X$ if, whenever $a\in A$, we can find a $\delta>0$ (depending on $a$) such that
\be
x\in A\ \text{whenever}\ d(x,a)<\delta.
\ee

That is, for any $a\in A$, there exists $\delta >0$ such that $B_\delta(a) \subseteq A$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:open ball properties}
\ben
\item [(i)] Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. If $r>0$, then $B_r(x)=\bra{y:d(x,y)<r}$ is open.
\item [(ii)] If we work in $\R^n$ with the Euclidean metric, then the one point set $\bra{x}$ is not open.
\item [(iii)] If $(X,d)$ is a discrete metric space, then $\bra{x} = B_{1/2}(x)$ and all subsets of $X$ are open.
\een
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
\ben
\item [(i)] If $y\in B_r(x)$, then $\delta=r-d(x,y)>0$ and, whenever $d(z,y)<\delta$, the triangle inequality gives us
\be
d(x,z)\leq d(x,y)+d(y,z)<r
\ee
so $z\in B_r(x)$. Thus $B_r(x)$ is open.

\item [(ii)] Choose $a \in \R^{n}$ with $\dabs{a}=1$. (We could take $a=(1,0,0,\dots,0)$.) For any $\delta>0$, then, setting $y=x+ a\delta/2$,
we have $\dabs{x-y} < \delta$, yet $y \notin \bra{x}$. Thus $\bra{x}$ is not open.

\item [(iii)] Recalling Definition \ref{def:discrete_metric_space}, we observe that $d(x,x)=0<1/2$ and $d(x,y)=1>1/2$ for $x\neq y$. Therefore, $\bra{x}$ is open.

For any subset $E$, if $x\in E$ then $d(x,y)<1/2$ implies $y=x\in E$ so $E$ is open.
\een
\end{proof}

\begin{example}\label{exa:countable intersection open_set_metric_space}
Let us work in $\R^{n}$ with the usual metric. Then the open ball $B(x,1/j)$ is open (by Theorem \ref{thm:open ball properties}.(i)) but
$\bigcap_{j=1}^{\infty} B(x,1/j)=\bra{x}$ is not.
\end{example}
%\begin{proof} See Example~\ref{E;Open ball open}.\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. Given an open ball $B_r(x)$ and any point $y\in B_r(x)$, there exists $\ve >0$ such that $B_{\ve}(y) \subseteq B_r(x)$.
\end{corollary}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
This is direct result by Theorem \ref{thm:open ball properties}.(i) and Definition \ref{def:open set_metric_space}.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Properties of open sets}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:open_set_metric}
If $(X,d)$ is a metric space, then the following statements are true.
\ben
\item [(i)] The empty set $\emptyset$ and the space $X$ are open.
\item [(ii)] If $U_i$ is open for all $i\in I$, then $\bigcup_{i \in I} U_i$ is open. (In other words, the union of open sets is open.)
\item [(iii)] If $U_{j}$ is open for all $1\leq j\leq n$, then $\bigcap_{j=1}^{n} U_{j}$ is open.
\een
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
It is important to realise that we place no restriction on the size of $I$ in (ii). In particular, $I$ could be uncountable. However, conclusion (iii) cannot be extended.
\end{remark}



\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
\ben
\item [(i)] Since there are no points $a$ in $\emptyset$, the statement
\be
x\in \emptyset\quad \text{whenever}\ d(x,a)<1
\ee
holds for all $a\in \emptyset$. Since every point $x$ belongs to $X$, the statement
\be
x\in X\quad \text{whenever}\ d(x,a)<1
\ee
holds for all $a\in X$.

\item [(ii)] If $a\in \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$, then we can find a particular $i_1\in I$ with $a\in U_{i_1}$. Since $U_{i_{1}}$ is open, we can find a $\delta>0$ such that
\be
x\in U_{i_{1}}\quad \text{whenever}\ d(x,a)<\delta.
\ee

Since $U_{i_{1}}\subseteq \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$,
\be
x\in \bigcup_{i\in I} U_i \quad \text{whenever}\ d(x,a)<\delta \ \ra \ \text{ $\bigcup_{i\in I} U_i$ is open. }
\ee

\item [(iii)] If $a\in \bigcap_{j=1}^{n} U_j$ then $a\in U_{j}$ for each $1\leq j\leq n$. Since $U_{j}$ is open, we can find a $\delta_{j}>0$ such that
\be
x\in U_{j}\quad \text{whenever}\ d(x,a)<\delta_{j}.
\ee

Setting $\delta=\min_{1\leq j\leq n}\delta_{j}$, we have $\delta>0$ and
\be
x \in U_{j}\quad \text{whenever}\ d(x,a)<\delta
\ee
for all $1\leq j\leq n$. Thus
\be
x\in \bigcap_{j=1}^{n} U_{j}\quad \text{whenever}\ d(x,e)<\delta \ \ra\ \text{ $\bigcap_{j=1}^{n} U_{j}$ is open. }
\ee
\een
\end{proof}


There is a remarkable connection between the notion of open sets and continuity.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:metric continuous open}
Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f:X \to Y$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$ whenever $U$ is open in $Y$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
Note that the theorem does not work `in the opposite direction'.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
($\ra$). Suppose first that $f$ is continuous and that $U$ is open in $Y$. For any $x\in f^{-1}(U)$, then we can find a $y\in U$ with $f(x)=y$. Since $U$ is open in $Y$, we can find an $\ve>0$ such that
\be
z\in U\quad \text{whenever }\ d_Y(y,z)< \ve.
\ee

Since $f$ is continuous, we can find a $\delta>0$ such that
\be
d_Y(y,f(w))=d_Y(f(x),f(w))<\ve \quad \text{whenever }\ d_X(x,w)<\delta.
\ee

Thus, we can find $\delta >0$ such that
\be
f(w)\in U\quad \text{whenever }\ d_X(x,w)<\delta \ \ra \ w\in f^{-1}(U)\quad \text{whenever }\ d(x,w)<\delta.
\ee

Thus, we have shown that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open (as $x\in f^{-1}(U)$).

($\la$). Suppose that $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $X$ whenever $U$ is open in $Y$. For any $x\in X$ and $\ve>0$. We know that the open ball
\be
B(f(x),\ve)=\bra{y\in Y: d_Y(f(x),y)<\ve} \quad \text{is open in $Y$ (by Theorem \ref{thm:open ball properties}.(i)).}
\ee
Thus
$x\in f^{-1}\bb{B(f(x),\ve)}$ and $f^{-1}\bb{B(f(x),\ve)}$ is open by assumption. It follows that there is a $\delta>0$ such that
\be
w\in f^{-1}\bb{B(f(x),\ve)} \quad \text{whenever }\ d_X(x,w)<\delta \ \ra\  f(w) \in B(f(x),\ve) \quad \text{whenever }\ d_X(x,w)<\delta.
\ee

So, in other words,
\be
d_Y(f(x),f(w))<\ve\quad \text{whenever }\ d_X(x,w)<\delta \ \ra \ \text{$f$ is continuous}
\ee
as required.
\end{proof}

\section{Closed Sets in Metric Space}

\subsection{Sequence in metric space}

Besides open set, the second class of well behaved sets identified by Cantor were the closed sets. In order to define closed sets in metric spaces we need a notion of limit. Fortunately, the classical definition
generalises without difficulty.

\begin{definition}[sequence, limit in metric space\index{sequence!metric space}]\label{def:limit_metric_space}
Consider a sequence $\bb{x_{n}}$ in a metric space $(X,d)$. If for $x\in X$ and any $\ve > 0$, we can find an integer $N\geq 1$ (depending on $\ve$) such that
\be
d(x_{n},x)<\ve \quad \text{for all $n\geq N$},
\ee
then we say that $x_{n} \to x$ as $n\to\infty$.
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}[uniqueness of limit]\label{thm:limit unique_metric_space}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. If a sequence $\bb{x_{n}}$ has a limit then that limit is unique.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
Suppose $x_{n}\to x$ and $x_{n}\to y$. Then, given any $\ve>0$, we can find $N_{1}$ and $N_{2}$ such that
\be
d(x_{n},x)<\ve/2\quad \text{for all $n\geq N_{1}$},\qquad d(x_{n},y)<\ve/2\quad \text{for all $n\geq N_{2}$}.
\ee

Taking $N=\max\bra{N_{1},N_{2}}$, we obtain
\be
d(x,y) \leq d(x_{N},x)+d(x_{N},y) < \ve/2+\ve/2=\ve.
\ee

Since $\ve$ was arbitrary, $d(x,y)=0$ and therefore $x=y$ by definition.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Closed sets in metric space}

\begin{definition}[closed set\index{closed set!metric space}]\label{def:closed_set_metric space}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. A set $V\subseteq X$ is said to be closed if, whenever $x_{n}\in V$ and $x_{n}\to x$ as $n\to\infty$, it follows that $x\in V$.
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:closed complements open_metric_space}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. A set $V$ in $X$ is closed if and only if its complement is open.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
$(\ra)$. Suppose that $V$ is closed and $A=X\bs V$. If $A$ is not open, we can find an $a\in A$ such that
\be
B_\delta(a) \cap V \neq \emptyset\quad \text{for all }\delta>0\qquad \text{(as we can find $B_\delta(a)\subseteq A$ for some $\delta$ if $A$ is open)}.
\ee

In particular, we can find $x_{n}\in V$ such that $d(x_{n},a)<1/n$ for each $n\geq 1$. Thus, $x_{n}\to a$. Since $V$ is closed, we have $a\in V$ contradicting our initial assumption that $a\in A$. Thus $A$ is open.

($\la$). Suppose $A$ is open and $V=X\bs A$. For any sequence $x_{n}\in V$ and $x_{n}\to x$. If $x\in A$, then, since $A$ is open we can find a $\delta>0$ such that $B_\delta(x)\subseteq A$.
Thus $d(x_{n},x)\geq \delta$ for all $n$ which is absurd. Thus $x\in V$ and $V$ is closed.
\end{proof}

We can now deduce properties of closed sets from properties of open sets by complementation. In particular, we have the following complementary versions of Theorems \ref{thm:open_set_metric} and \ref{thm:metric continuous open}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:closed_set_metric}
If $(X,d)$ is a metric space, then the following statements are true.
\ben
\item [(i)] The empty set $\emptyset$ and the space $X$ are closed.
\item [(ii)] If $V_i$ is closed for all $i\in I$, then $\bigcap_{i \in I} V_i$ is clsoed. (In other words, the intersection of closed sets is closed.)
\item [(iii)] If $V_{j}$ is closed for all $1\leq j\leq n$, then $\bigcup_{j=1}^{n} V_{j}$ is closed.
\een
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
\ben
\item [(i)] Observe that $\emptyset = X \bs X$ and $X=X\bs \emptyset$, we have (i) by Theorem \ref{thm:closed complements open_metric_space} and Theorem \ref{thm:open_set_metric}.(i).

\item [(ii)] Since $V_i$ is closed, $X\bs V_i$ is open for all $i \in I$. It follows that (by De Morgan laws, Theorem \ref{thm:basic_set_properties}.(viii))
\be
X\left\bs \bigcap_{i\in I} V_i \right. = \bigcup_{i\in I}\bb{X\bs V_i}
\ee
is open (by Theorem \ref{thm:open_set_metric}.(ii)) and so $\bigcap_{i\in I} V_i$ is closed.

(iii) Since $V_{j}$ is closed, $X\bs V_{j}$ is open for all $1\leq j\leq n$. It follows that
\be
X\left\bs \bigcup_{j=1}^{n} V_{j}\right. = \bigcap_{j=1}^{n}(X\bs V_{j})
\ee
is open (by Theorem \ref{thm:open_set_metric}.(iii)) and so $\bigcup_{j=1}^{n} V_{j}$ is closed.
\een
\end{proof}


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:metric continuous closed}
Let $(X,d_X)$ and $(Y,d_Y)$ be metric spaces. A function $f:X\to Y$ is continuous if and only if $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed in $X$ whenever $V$ is closed in $Y$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
We use the fact that $X = f^{-1}(Y)$.
\end{remark}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
($\ra$). Suppose that $f$ is continuous. If $V$ is closed in $Y$, then $Y\bs V$ is open, so by Proposition \ref{pro:inverse_image_preserves_set_operation}
\be
X \left\bs f^{-1}(V) \right. = f^{-1}(Y) \left\bs f^{-1}(V) \right. = f^{-1}(Y\bs V)
\ee
is open by Theorem \ref{thm:metric continuous open}. Thus $f^{-1}(V)$ is closed.

($\la$). Suppose $f^{-1}(V)$ in $X$ is closed whenever $V$ is closed in $Y$. For any open set $U \subseteq Y$, then $Y\bs U$ is closed (by Theorem \ref{thm:closed complements open_metric_space}). So by
\be
X\left\bs f^{-1}(U)\right. = f^{-1}(Y) \left\bs f^{-1}(U)\right. = f^{-1}(Y\bs U)
\ee
is closed by assumption.

Thus $f^{-1}(U)$ is open by Theorem \ref{thm:closed complements open_metric_space}. We have shown that $f$ is continuous by Theorem \ref{thm:metric continuous open}.
\end{proof}


\section{Closure, Interior and Boundary}

\subsection{Closure and limit points}

We have already remarked that a general subset of a metric space $(X,d)$ is likely to be neither open nor closed in $X$. However, we can get from an arbitrary subset of $X$ to one that is closed in
$X$ and also to one that is open in $X$, in rather natural ways. We shall explain first how to get from a general subset $A$ of $X$ to a related set, called the closure of $A$ in $X$, which is
closed in $X$. Intuitively, to get from $A$ to its closure, written $\ol{A}$, we add in all points of $X$ which are `arbitrarily close to $A$'.

\begin{definition}[closure\index{closure}]\label{def:closure}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space and $A$ be its subset. For $x\in X$, we say that $x$ is a point of closure of $A$ in $X$ if for any $\ve >0$ we have $B_\ve(x)\cap A\neq \emptyset$. The closure of $A$
in $X$ is the set of all points of closure of $A$ in $X$.

We denote the closure of $A$ in $X$ by $\ol{A}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\ben
\item [(i)] The closure of each of the intervals $(0,1)$, $[0,1)$, $(0,1]$, $[0,1]$ in $\R$ is the interval $[0,1]$.
\item [(ii)] The closure of $B_1((0,0))$ in $\R^2$ is $\bra{x\in \R^2:d_2(x,(0,0)) \leq 1}$.
\item [(iii)] If $A$ is non-empty bounded subset of $\R$ then $\sup A$ and $\inf A$ are in $\ol{A}$.
\een
\end{example}

\begin{definition}[dense set\index{dense!metric space}]\label{def:dense_set_metric_space}
A subset $A$ of a metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be dense in $(X,d)$ if $\ol{A} = X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:closure_properties}
Let $A,B$ be subsets of a metric space $(X,d)$. Then
\ben
\item [(i)] $A\subseteq \ol{A}$.
\item [(ii)] $A \subseteq B$ implies that $\ol{A}\subseteq \ol{B}$.
\item [(iii)] $A$ is closed in $X$ if and only if $\ol{A} = A$.
\item [(iv)] $\ol{\ol{A}} = \ol{A}$.
\item [(v)] $\ol{A}$ is closed in $X$.
\item [(vi)] $\ol{A}$ is the smallest closed subset of $X$ containing $A$.
\een
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
\footnote{proof needed.}
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:continuous_closure_relation}
A map $f:X\to Y$ of metric spaces is continuous if and only if
\be
f\bb{\ol{A}} \subseteq \ol{f(A)} \quad \text{for every }A\subseteq X.
\ee
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
\footnote{proof needed.}
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space, then
\ben
\item [(i)] Let $A_i$ be subsets of $(X,d)$ for all $1\leq i\leq n$, then
\be
\ol{\bigcup_{i=1}^n A_i} = \bigcup^n_{i=1}\ol{A_i}.
\ee
\item [(ii)] If $A_i$ be subsets of $(X,d)$ for all $i\in I$ ($I$ can be uncountable), then
\be
\ol{\bigcap_{i\in I} A_i} \subseteq \bigcap_{i\in I} \ol{A_i}.

For analysis it is often useful to consider limit points as well as closure.

\begin{definition}[limit point\index{limit point!metric space}]\label{def:limit_point}
A point $x$ in a metric space $(X,d)$ is said to be a limit point of a subset $A\in X$ if given $\ve>0$ there is a point in $B_\ve(x)\cap A$ other than $x$ itself, i.e.,
\be
\bb{B_\ve(x)\bs\bra{x}}\cap A \neq \emptyset.
\ee
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
A subset $A$ of metric space $(X,d)$ is closed in $X$ if and only if it contains all its limit points in $X$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]

\end{proof}


\subsection{Interior}

The idea of interior is dual to the idea of closure. The closure of a subset $A$ adds in all points which are intuitively very close to $A$, whereas the interior of $A$ consists of all points which
are `well inside' $A$.

\begin{definition}[interior\index{interior}]\label{def:interior}
The interior $\inter{A}$ of a subset $A$ in metric space $(X,d)$ is the set of points $a\in A$ such that $B_\ve(a)\subseteq A$ for some $\ve >0$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\ben
\item [(i)] The interior of any of the interval $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$, $[a,b]$ in $\R$ is $(a,b)$.
\item [(ii)] The interior of $\Q$ in $\R$ is $\emptyset$.
\een
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}\label{pro:interior_properties}
Let $A,B$ be subsets of a metric space $(X,d)$. Then
\ben
\item [(i)] $\inter{A}\subseteq A$.
\item [(ii)] $A \subseteq B$ implies that $\inter{A}\subseteq \inter{B}$.
\item [(iii)] $A$ is open in $X$ if and only if $\inter{A} = A$.
\item [(iv)] $\inter{\inter{A}} = \inter{A}$.
\item [(v)] $\inter{A}$ is open in $X$.
\item [(vi)] $\inter{A}$ is the largest open subset of $X$ containing $A$.
\een
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]
\footnote{proof needed.}
\end{proof}


\subsection{Boundary}

\begin{definition}
The boundary $\partial A$ of a subset $A$ in metric space $(X,d)$ is the set $\left.\ol{A}\right\bs \inter{A}$.
\end{definition}

\begin{example}
\ben
\item [(i)] In $\R$, the boundary of each interval $(a,b)$, $[a,b)$, $(a,b]$, $[a,b]$ is $\bra{a,b}$. The boundary of $[0,1]\cup \bra{2}$ is $\bra{0,1,2}$.
\item [(ii)] The boundary of $\Q$ in $\R$ is $\R$.
\een
\end{example}

\begin{proposition}
Given a subset $A$ of metric space $(X,d)$, a point $x\in X$ is in $\partial A$ if and only if for every $\ve >0$ both $A\cap B_\ve(x)$ and $(X\bs A)\cap B_\ve(x)$ are non-empty.
\end{proposition}

\section{Equivalent Metrics}

\begin{definition}[topologically equivalent metrics\index{topologically equivalent metrics}]\label{def:topologically_equivalent_metric}
Metrics $d_1,d_2$ on a set $X$ are called topologically equivalent if a subset $U$ of $X$ is $d_1$-open in $X$ iff it is $d_2$-open in $X$.%\footnote{see Metric and Topological Space}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Lipschitz equivalent metrics\index{Lipschitz equivalent metrics}]\label{def:lipschitz_equivalent_metric}
Two metrics $d_1,d_2$ on a set $X$ are called Lipschitz equivalent if there are positive constants $k,K$ such that for any $x,y \in X$,
\be
kd_2(x,y) \leq d_1(x,y) \leq Kd_2(x,y).
\ee
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\footnote{need checking}
Lipschitz equivalent metrics are topologically equivalent.
