\begin{definition}[metric\index{metric}, metric space\index{metric space}]\label{def:metric}
A metric on a set $X$ is a function (called the distance function or simply distance) $d : X \times X \to \R$ (where $\R$ is the set of real numbers). For all $x, y, z \in X$, this function is required to satisfy the following conditions:
\ben
\item [(i)] $d(x, y) \geq 0$. (non-negativity, or separation axiom)
\item [(ii)] $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$. (identity of indiscernibles, or coincidence axiom)
\item [(iii)] $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$. (symmetry)
\item [(iv)] $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$. (subadditivity / triangle inequality)
\een

Then $(X,d)$ is called metric space.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Note that (i) and (ii) together produce positive definiteness and (i) is implied by the others.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[ultrametric\index{ultrametric}]\label{def:ultrametric}
A metric is called an ultrametric if it satisfies the following stronger version of the triangle inequality where points can never fall `between' other points:
\be
d(x, z) \leq \max\bra{d(x, y), d(y, z)},\quad \forall x, y, z \in X.
\ee
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[intrinsic metric\index{intrinsic metric}]\label{def:intrinsic_metric}
A metric $d$ on $X$ is called intrinsic if any two points $x,y \in X$ can be joined by a curve with length arbitrarily close to $d(x, y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[translation invariant metric\index{translation invariant!metric}]\label{def:translation_invariant_metric}
For sets on which an addition $+ : X \times X \to X$ is defined, $d$ is called a translation invariant metric if
\be
d(x, y) = d(x + a, y + a),\quad x,y \in X.
\ee
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[pseudometric\index{pseudometric}]\label{def:pseudometric}
A pseudometric on $X$ is a function $d : X \times X \to \R$ which satisfies the axioms for a metric, except that instead of the second (identity of indiscernibles) only $d(x,x)=0$ for all $x$ is required. In other words, the axioms for a pseudometric are: for any $x,y,z \in X$,
\ben
\item [(i)] $d(x, y) \geq 0$.
\item [(ii)] $d(x, x) = 0$ (but possibly $d(x,y)=0$ for some distinct values $x\neq y$).
\item [(iii)] $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$.
\item [(iv)] $d(x, z) \leq  d(x, y) + d(y, z)$.
\een
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
This is the most common generalization of metrics. In some contexts, pseudometrics are referred to as semimetrics because of their relation to seminorms\footnote{need details}.
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[quasimetric\index{quasimetric}]\label{def:quasimetric}
A quasimetric is defined as a function that satisfies all axioms for a metric with the possible exception of symmetry:
\ben
\item [(i)] $d(x, y) \geq 0$. (positivity)
\item [(ii)] $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$. (positive definiteness)
\item [(iii)] $d(x, z) \leq d(x, y) + d(y, z)$ (triangle inequality)
\een
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Quasimetrics are common in real life. For example, given a set $X$ of mountain villages, the typical walking times between elements of $X$ form a quasimetric because travel up hill takes longer than travel down hill. Another example is a taxicab geometry topology having one-way streets, where a path from point $A$ to point $B$ comprises a different set of streets than a path from $B$ to $A$. Nevertheless, this notion is rarely used in mathematics, and its name is not entirely standardized (see Rolewicz\cite{Rolewicz_1987}).
\end{remark}

\begin{example}
A quasimetric on the reals can be defined by setting
\be
d(x, y) = \left\{ \ba{ll} 
x - y\quad\quad & x \geq y,\\
1 & \text{otherwise}
\ea\right.
\ee

The 1 may be replaced by infinity or by $1+10(y-x)$. 

The topological space underlying this quasimetric space is the Sorgenfrey line. This space describes the process of filing down a metal stick: it is easy to reduce its size, but it is difficult or impossible to grow it.
\end{example}

\begin{example}
If $d$ is a quasimetric on $X$, a metric $d'$ on $X$ can be formed by taking
\be
d'(x, y) = (d(x, y) + d(y, x))/2.
\ee
\end{example} 

\begin{definition}[semimetric\index{semimetric}]\label{def:semimetric}
A semimetric on $X$ is a function $d : X \times X \to\R$ that satisfies the first three axioms, but not necessarily the triangle inequality:
\ben
\item [(i)] $d(x, y) \geq 0$.
\item [(ii)] $d(x, y) = 0$ if and only if $x = y$.
\item [(iii)] $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$.
\een
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Some mathematicians work with a weaker form of the triangle inequality, such as:
\beast
& & d(x, z) \leq \rho (d(x, y) + d(y, z)) \qquad (\text{$ρ$-relaxed triangle inequality})\\
& & d(x, z) \leq \rho \max\bra{d(x, y), d(y, z)}\qquad (\text{$ρ$-inframetric inequality}). 
\eeast
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[topologically equivalent metrics]
\footnote{see Metric and Topological Space}
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[Lipschitz equivalent metrics\index{Lipschitz equivalent metrics}]\label{def:lipschitz_equivalent_metric}
Two metrics $d_1,d_2$ on a set $X$ are called Lipschitz equivalent if there are positive constants $k,K$ such that for any $x,y \in X$,
\be
kd_2(x,y) \leq d_1(x,y) \leq Kd_2(x,y).
\ee
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\footnote{need checking}
Lipschitz equivalent metrics are topologically equivalent.
\end{proposition}


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:properties_metric_open}\footnote{need checking} 
If $(X,d)$ is a metric space, then the following statements are true.
\ben
\item [(i)] The empty set $\emptyset$ and the space $X$ are open.
\item [(ii)] If $U_{\alpha}$ is open for all $\alpha\in A$, then $\bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_{\alpha}$ is open. (In other words, the union of open sets is open.)
\item [(iii)] If $U_{j}$ is open for all $1\leq j\leq n$, then $\bigcap_{j=1}^{n} U_{j}$ is open.
\een
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]\footnote{need checking}
\ben
\item [(i)] Since there are no points $e$ in $\emptyset$, the statement $x\in \emptyset\ \text{whenever}\ d(x,e)<1$ holds for all $e\in \emptyset$. Since every point $x$ belongs to $X$, the statement $x\in X\ \text{whenever}\ d(x,e)<1$ holds for all $e\in X$.
\item [(ii)] If $e\in \bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_{\alpha}$, then we can find a particular $\alpha_{1}\in A$ with $e\in U_{\alpha_{1}}$. Since $U_{\alpha_{1}}$ is open, we can find a $\delta>0$ such that $x\in U_{\alpha_{1}}\ \text{whenever}\ d(x,e)<\delta$.

Since $U_{\alpha_{1}}\subseteq \bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_{\alpha}$, $x\in \bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_{\alpha}  \text{whenever}\ d(x,e)<\delta$. Thus $\bigcup_{\alpha\in A} U_{\alpha}$ is open.

\item [(iii)] If $e\in \bigcap_{j=1}^{n} U_{j}$ then $e\in U_{j}$ for each $1\leq j\leq n$. Since $U_{j}$ is open, we can find a $\delta_{j}>0$ such that $x\in U_{j}\ \text{whenever}\ d(x,e)<\delta_{j}$. Setting $\delta=\min_{1\leq j\leq n}\delta_{j}$, we have $\delta>0$ and $x\in U_{j}\ \text{whenever}\ d(x,e)<\delta$ for all $1\leq j\leq n $. Thus
\be
x\in \bigcap_{j=1}^{n} U_{j}\ \text{whenever}\ d(x,e)<\delta
\ee
and we have shown that $\bigcap_{j=1}^{n} U_{j}$ is open.

\end{proof} 

\begin{definition}\label{def:lipschitz_continuous}\footnote{need checking}
Given two metric spaces $(X, d_X)$ and $(Y, d_Y)$, where $d_X$ denotes the metric on the set $X$ and $d_Y$ is the metric on set $Y$. A function $f: X \to Y$ is called Lipschitz continuous\index{Lipschitz continuous} if there exists a real constant $K \geq 0$ such that, for all $x_1$ and $x_2$ in $X$,
\be
d_Y(f(x_1), f(x_2)) \le K d_X(x_1, x_2).
\ee

Any such $K$ is referred to as a Lipschitz constant\index{Lipschitz constant} for the function $f$. The smallest constant is sometimes called the (best) Lipschitz constant. The space of Lipschitz continuous functions with constant $K$ is $\lip_K(X,Y)$ and the space of Lipschitz continous functions on $X$ is $\lip(X,Y) = \bigcup\limits_{K>0}\lip_K(X,Y)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}\footnote{need checking}
Lipschitz continuity is a strong form of uniform continuity.
\end{remark}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:zero_one_lipschitz}\footnote{need checking}
Let $(X,d)$ be a metric space. For any closed set $A\subseteq X$ and any $\ve>0$, there is a Lipschitz continuous map $\rho_{A,\ve}:X\to [0,1]$ with
\be
\rho_{A,\ve}(x) = \left\{\ba{ll}
1 \quad\quad & \text{if }x\in A,\\
0 & \text{if }d(x,A) \geq \ve.
\ea\right.
\ee
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}[\bf Proof]\footnote{need checking}
Let $\varphi:\R \to [0,1]$, $t \mapsto (t\vee 0)\wedge 1$. For $x\in X$, define $\rho_{A,\ve} = 1 - \varphi(\ve^{-1}d(x,A))$.
\end{proof}
