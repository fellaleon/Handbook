\subsection{Topology and topological space}

\begin{definition}[topology\index{topology}, topological space\index{topological space}]
A topological space $T= (X,\sT)$ consists of a non-empty set $X$ together with a fixed family $\sT$ of subsets of $X$ satisfying
\ben
\item [(i)] $X,\emptyset \in \sT$,
\item [(ii)] the intersection of finitely many sets in $\sT$ is in $\sT$,
\item [(iii)] the union of any collection of sets in $\sT$ is in $\sT$.
\een

The family $\sT$ is called a topology for $X$.
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Note that the collection can be uncountable in (iii).
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}[open set in topological space\index{open set!topological space}]
Let $T=(X,\sT)$ be a topological space. Then the members of $sT$ are called the open sets of $T$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}[continuous topological space\index{continuous!topological space}]\label{def:continuous_topological_space}
We say that $f : E \to \R$ is continuous, if $f^{-1}(U)$ is open in $E$ whenever $U$ is open in $\R$.
\end{definition}

\section{Spaces}


\begin{definition}[second-countable space\index{second-countable space}]\label{def:second_countable_space}
A second-countable space, also called a completely separable space, is a topological space satisfying the second axiom of countability\footnote{need details}. 

A space is said to be second-countable if its topology has a countable base. More explicitly, this means that a topological space $X$ is second countable if there exists some countable collection $\sU = \bra{U_i}_{i=1}^\infty$ of open subsets of $X$ such that any open subset of $X$ can be written as a union of elements of some subfamily of $\sU$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
Like other countability axioms, the property of being second-countable restricts the number of open sets that a space can have.
\end{remark}

\section{Function Sequence}

\begin{definition}[convergence on compact\index{convergence on compact}]\label{def:convergence_on_compact}
Let $(X, \sT)$ be a topological space and $(Y,d_Y)$ be a metric space. A sequence of functions
\be
f_{n} : X \to Y,\quad n \in \N,
\ee
is said to converge on compact (or converge compactly) as $n \to \infty$ to some function $f : X \to Y$ if, for every compact set $K \subseteq X$, $\forall x\in K$,
\be
\lim_{n\to\infty} d_Y\bb{f_{n}(x), f(x)} = 0.
\ee
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[uniform convergence on compact\index{uniform convergence on compact}]\label{def:uniform_convergence_on_compact}
Let $(X, \sT)$ be a topological space and $(Y,d_Y)$ be a metric space. A sequence of functions
\be
f_{n} : X \to Y, n \in \N,
\ee
is said to converge uniformly on compact (or converge uniformly compactly) as $n \to \infty$ to some function $f : X \to Y$ if, for every compact set $K \subseteq X$,
\be
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sup_{x \in K} d_{Y} \left( f_{n} (x), f(x) \right) = 0.
\ee
\end{definition}%converges uniformly on K as n \to \infty. This means that for all compact K \subseteq X,
