\section{Utility Theory}

Image that you are given a choice between receiving a certain amount of money or taking a bet that has a 50 percent change of winning \$100 and a 50 percent chance of winning nothing. Clearly the bet has an expected value
of \$50. If you would rather receive a certain payoff of less than \$50, you are risk-averse. If you would take \$50 you are risk-neutral. If you would only accept more than \$50, you are risk-seeking(see
\cite{Sinclair_2013}.$P_{96}$).
